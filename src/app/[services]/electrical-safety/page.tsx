        description="Under new Victorian legislation, rental providers must ensure an electrical safety check is completed for their property every two years by a licensed electrician. Furthermore, landlords are required to maintain a record of these inspections, including the name and registration number of the person who performed the check, the date of the check, and a copy of the compliance report.
When you book through RentalEase, you have peace of mind that all these compliance and regulatory requirements are fulfilled and documented for you automatically in your portal."
