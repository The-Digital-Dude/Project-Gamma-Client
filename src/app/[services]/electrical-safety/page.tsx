Crucially, the legislation also defines smoke alarm non-compliance as an urgent repair. This means landlords must act immediately to rectify any faults reported by tenants. The Rentalease platform helps you manage these obligations effortlessly by providing reminders, professional servicing, and a clear audit trail."
