# Gemini Code Generation Guidelines

This document outlines the coding conventions and standards to be followed by the Gemini AI assistant when generating code for this project. The goal is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality code that aligns with the existing codebase.

## 1. General Principles

- **Adhere to Existing Conventions:** All generated code must strictly follow the conventions, patterns, and architectural choices already established in the project. Analyze the surrounding code before generating new code.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** New features should be built using a component-based architecture. Components should be reusable, modular, and placed in appropriate directories.
- **TypeScript First:** All new code should be written in TypeScript, leveraging its static typing capabilities to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Next.js App Router:** We use the Next.js App Router. All new pages and components should be created following its conventions. Client-side components should include the `"use client";` directive at the top of the file.

## 2. File and Directory Structure

- **Components:** Reusable components should be placed in the `src/components` directory. Each component should have its own directory containing the component file (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`) and its corresponding stylesheet (e.g., `MyComponent.module.scss`). An `index.ts` file should be used to export the component from its directory.
- **Pages:** New pages should be created as subdirectories within the `src/app` directory. Each page should have a `page.tsx` file.
- **Styling:** Use SCSS modules for component-level styling. Global styles are located in the `src/styles` directory.

## 3. Coding Style

- **Imports:** Use absolute paths with the `@/` alias for imports within the `src` directory (e.g., `import MyComponent from '@/components/MyComponent';`).
- **Naming Conventions:**
    - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent`).
    - Files: PascalCase for components (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`), kebab-case for pages and other files (e.g., `my-page/page.tsx`).
    - Variables and Functions: camelCase (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction`).
- **React:**
    - Use functional components with hooks.
    - Use `React.FC` for typing functional components.
    - Use `useState` for simple component state and `useReducer` for more complex state logic.
    - Use `useEffect` for side effects, with proper dependency arrays.
    - Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to optimize performance where necessary.
- **TypeScript:**
    - Use `const` by default, and `let` only when a variable needs to be reassigned.
    - Use explicit types for function parameters and return values.
    - Avoid using `any` whenever possible.

## 4. Styling

- **SCSS Modules:** Use SCSS modules for component-level styles to avoid class name collisions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is available and can be used for utility-first styling where appropriate.
- **Variables:** Use the SCSS variables defined in `src/styles/_variables.scss` for consistent theming.

## 5. Linting and Formatting

- **ESLint:** All generated code must adhere to the ESLint rules defined in the `.eslintrc` file.
- **Formatting:** Code should be formatted consistently. While there is no Prettier configuration file, we should follow standard TypeScript and React formatting conventions.

## 6. Future Development

- **Subscription Feature:** The next major feature to be implemented is a subscription system. This will involve creating new components for pricing plans, checkout forms, and user subscription management. All new code for this feature must follow the guidelines outlined in this document.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the codebase remains clean, consistent, and easy to maintain as we add new features.
